# PointwiseShapeAdaptiveTextureFiltering
In this implementation, each pixel can find an arbitrarily shaped "clean" local area for filtering with the help of line shift scheme.

Before you can run "SingleProcessRun.m", you should first download the Structure Edge Detection Toolbox V3.0 written by Piotr Dollar and unpack it under the subdirectory named of "edge-master".

If you use this software, we appreciate it if you cite an appropriate subset of the following papers:
1) B. Liu and X. Lu, "Pointwise shape-adaptive texture filtering," in Proc. of ICME, 2018.
2) B. Liu and X. Lu, "A shape-aware structure-preserving texture smoothing algorithm," in Proc. of ICIP, 2019.
